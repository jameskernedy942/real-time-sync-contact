# Fix for art::ConditionVariable::WaitHoldingLocks Error

## Problem Analysis

The `art::ConditionVariable::WaitHoldingLocks` error indicates a deadlock situation where:
- A thread is waiting on a condition while holding locks
- Multiple threads/coroutines are blocking each other
- Synchronous blocking operations are being called from coroutines

## Identified Issues in Current Code

### 1. **Blocking RabbitMQ Operations in Coroutines**
- `channel.basicAck()` is a blocking operation
- `channel.basicPublish()` blocks the thread
- `connection.createChannel()` is synchronous

### 2. **Nested Coroutine Launches**
- Message handler launches coroutines inside coroutines
- Multiple scopes launching simultaneously
- No proper structured concurrency

### 3. **Improper Dispatcher Usage**
- Everything uses `Dispatchers.IO`
- No separation between blocking and non-blocking operations
- Thread pool exhaustion possible

### 4. **Synchronization Issues**
- AtomicBoolean checks with coroutine operations
- Race conditions in connection state management
- Multiple threads accessing RabbitMQ channel

## Root Cause

The deadlock occurs when:
1. Main coroutine holds a lock on the RabbitMQ channel
2. Message handler tries to ACK a message (needs channel lock)
3. Another coroutine tries to publish to SYNC_SUCCESS (needs channel lock)
4. All threads in IO dispatcher are blocked waiting for locks

## Solutions to Implement

### Solution 1: Use Channel-Safe Operations
### Solution 2: Implement Proper Thread Isolation
### Solution 3: Use Kotlin Channels for Communication
### Solution 4: Add Timeout and Cancellation Handling
