# Fix Report: Duplicate Connection Issue

## üî¥ CRITICAL ISSUES FOUND IN LOGS

### 1. **Multiple Connections Created Simultaneously**
The logs clearly show duplicate connections being created:
- Multiple "CONNECTING" events for the same queue within milliseconds
- Pattern: Connect ‚Üí Clean Shutdown (200 OK) ‚Üí Reconnect ‚Üí Loop
- This causes resource exhaustion and eventual service death

### 2. **JobCancellationException Root Cause**
- Service creates multiple coroutines for same connection
- When service dies, all coroutines are cancelled
- This triggers the JobCancellationException

### 3. **Clean Channel Shutdown Pattern**
```
CONNECTED successfully
SHUTDOWN: clean channel shutdown (200 OK)
RECONNECT_SCHEDULED
```
This indicates RabbitMQ is rejecting duplicate consumers on the same queue.

## ‚úÖ FIXES IMPLEMENTED

### 1. **GlobalConnectionRegistry (NEW)**
- **Location**: `/connection/GlobalConnectionRegistry.kt`
- **Purpose**: Singleton registry tracking ALL active connections
- **Features**:
  - Prevents connections within 5 seconds of each other
  - Rejects duplicate connections to same queue
  - Thread-safe with synchronized blocks

### 2. **Enhanced ThreadSafeAMQPConnection**
- Added `isReconnecting` atomic flag to prevent duplicate reconnection attempts
- Modified `scheduleReconnect()` to use compare-and-set
- Added special handling for "clean shutdown" (200 OK) - waits 30 seconds
- Integration with GlobalConnectionRegistry

### 3. **ConnectionStateManager Improvements**
- Already implemented but now works with GlobalConnectionRegistry
- Provides additional layer of protection

## üõ°Ô∏è MULTIPLE LAYERS OF PROTECTION

1. **Global Level**: GlobalConnectionRegistry prevents any duplicate queue connections
2. **Service Level**: ConnectionStateManager with mutexes
3. **Connection Level**: Atomic flags and compare-and-set operations
4. **RabbitMQ Level**: Clean shutdown detection with backoff

## üìä HOW IT PREVENTS THE ISSUE

### Before Fix:
```
Thread 1: Connect to APK_SYNC_628111 ‚Üí Success
Thread 2: Connect to APK_SYNC_628111 ‚Üí Success (DUPLICATE!)
RabbitMQ: Closes channel (200 OK)
Both threads: Reconnect immediately
‚Üí Loop continues until resource exhaustion
```

### After Fix:
```
Thread 1: Connect to APK_SYNC_628111 ‚Üí Registers in GlobalRegistry ‚Üí Success
Thread 2: Connect to APK_SYNC_628111 ‚Üí Rejected by GlobalRegistry ‚Üí Fails
RabbitMQ: Single consumer maintained
‚Üí Stable connection
```

## üéØ EXPECTED RESULTS

1. **No More Duplicate Connections**: GlobalRegistry ensures single connection per queue
2. **No More JobCancellationException**: Single coroutine per connection
3. **Stable 24/7 Operation**: No resource exhaustion
4. **Proper Reconnection**: Controlled reconnection with backoff

## üì± DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS

1. Build the APK with these changes
2. Uninstall the current app (to clear any corrupted state)
3. Install the new APK
4. Grant all permissions
5. Start the service

## üîç MONITORING

Check logs for:
- "GlobalConnectionRegistry" entries showing rejection of duplicates
- No more "clean channel shutdown" loops
- Stable "HEALTH_CHECK" with consistent connection status

## üí° KEY INSIGHT

The issue wasn't just about preventing duplicate connections at creation time - it was about preventing duplicate **reconnection attempts** that happen when RabbitMQ closes the channel. The clean shutdown (200 OK) was RabbitMQ's way of saying "you already have a consumer on this queue".
