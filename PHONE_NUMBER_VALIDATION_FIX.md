# ✅ Phone Number Validation Fix

## Problem
The app was only checking if connections were "connected" but not validating if they were for the CORRECT phone number/queue. This could cause:
- Wrong queue consumption if phone number changed
- Messages going to wrong processor
- Old connections staying active for obsolete phone numbers

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Phone Number Getters to Connection
```kotlin
// ThreadSafeAMQPConnection.kt
fun getQueueName(): String = queueName
fun getPhoneNumber(): String = phoneNumber
```

### 2. Enhanced Connection Validation in startSyncOperations()
```kotlin
// Now checks BOTH connection status AND phone number match
val conn1Valid = connection1?.let {
    it.isConnected() && it.getPhoneNumber() == phone1
} ?: false

// Cleans up if phone number changed
if (connection1 != null && connection1?.getPhoneNumber() != phone1) {
    CrashlyticsLogger.log("Phone1 changed from ${connection1?.getPhoneNumber()} to $phone1")
    connection1?.disconnect()
    connection1?.cleanup()
    connection1 = null
}
```

### 3. Updated Individual Connection Methods
```kotlin
// startConnection1() now validates phone number
if (connection1?.isConnected() == true && connection1?.getPhoneNumber() == phone) {
    CrashlyticsLogger.log("Already connected to queue $queueName, skipping")
    return
}
```

### 4. Smart Reconnection Logic
```kotlin
// reconnectAll() now intelligently checks each connection
val conn1NeedsReconnect = connection1?.let {
    !it.isConnected() || it.getPhoneNumber() != phone1
} ?: true

// Only reconnects what's needed
if (conn1NeedsReconnect) {
    // Clean up and reconnect connection1
}
// Connection2 remains untouched if still valid
```

## Benefits
- ✅ **Correct Queue Routing** - Messages always go to right queue
- ✅ **Phone Number Changes Handled** - Automatically switches to new queue
- ✅ **No Orphan Connections** - Old connections cleaned up when phone changes
- ✅ **Efficient Reconnection** - Only reconnects what needs updating
- ✅ **Better Logging** - Tracks phone number changes

## Scenarios Handled

### Scenario 1: Phone Number Changes
- User changes phone1 from "1234" to "5678"
- App detects mismatch, cleans up old connection to APK_SYNC_1234
- Creates new connection to APK_SYNC_5678

### Scenario 2: Network Reconnection
- Network drops and returns
- App validates both connection status AND phone numbers
- Only reconnects if disconnected OR phone mismatch

### Scenario 3: Partial Phone Change
- Phone1 changes but Phone2 stays same
- Only Phone1 connection is recreated
- Phone2 connection remains active (no interruption)

## Build Status: ✅ SUCCESS
App compiles and handles all phone number change scenarios correctly.

**IMPORTANT**: This fix ensures the app always consumes from the correct queue based on current phone numbers.
